# SCRAMBLE

This challenge was kinda like Wordle, with the twist that you had to guess a completely random string. The game gives you a wordlist of 12000 words and the requirement to get the flag was, to solve 100 games in less than 500 total guesses. After failing 5 times for one game, we get a new game but without getting a new solve.

The server lets us guess 7 times per word and it sends us a string back, which tells us how close we are.

example:

secret: SEINR <br>
guess: EEONE <br>
comparison: \*\+\-\+\*

\* means that that character in the guess is also in the secret word, + means that the position is right and - tells us that the character is not inside the secret.

I wrote a function that removes wrong words from the wordlist by using the comparison we got back:

```py
def eliminate(res, guess, wl):
    result = []
    for e in wl:
        flg = True
        for i in range(5):
            if res[i] == "*" or res[i] == "+":
                if guess[i] not in e:
                    flg = False
            if res[i] == "+":
                if guess[i] != e[i]:
                    flg = False
            if res[i] == "-":
                if guess[i] in e:
                    flg = False
        if flg and e != guess:
            result.append(e)
    return result
```

And then also some code to communicate with the server (of course I also tested it locally):

```py
def pwn():
    conn = remote("scamble.rumble.host", 2568)

    old_wordlist = conn.recvuntil(b'>').decode().split("\n[")[1].split("\n")[1:]

    while True:
        wordlist = old_wordlist
        while True:
            choice = ""
            if len(wordlist) == 12000:
                choice = rng.choice(wordlist)
            else:
                choice = rng.choice(wordlist)
            conn.sendline(choice)
            res = conn.recvuntil(b'> ').decode().strip()
            if "avg" in res:
                conn.interactive()
            if "[guess correct]" in res or "[number of guesses exceeded]" in res:
                conn.recvline()
                r = conn.recvline().decode()
                if "avg" in r:
                    print(r)
                    try:
                        print(conn.recvline())
                    except:
                        pass
                    conn.close()
                    return
                conn.recvuntil(b'> ').decode()
                break
            res = res.split("\n")[0]
            wordlist = getpossible(res, choice, wordlist)

while True:
    pwn()
```

It fetches the wordlist, then randomly chooses a word each time and eliminates using the feedback from the server.

But that was sadly not enough. I optimized my code a bit by trying to find good guesses. I tried some things like e.g. choosing guesses that are as far apart from the previous guess as possible but that did not really improve my score. Luckily, choosing a good starting guess, which includes one of the words with the least amount of duplicates possible.

```py
def getstartinggoodguess(wl):
    scores = {1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: []}
    for e in wl:
        scores[max([e.count(x) for x in e])].append(e)
    for j in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
        if len(scores[j]) != 0:
            return scores[j][0]
```

With some additional luck and a few tries later I finally got the flag! (With a score of 4.82)
